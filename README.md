FIFO Depth Calculation for Burst Data

Parameters:

Burst Size: 1500 bytes

FIFO Data Width: 32 bits (4 bytes per word)

Write Clock: 10 MHz

Read Clock: 100 MHz

Step 1: Number of FIFO Words Needed

Each FIFO word can hold 4 bytes. Therefore, the total number of words required to store the 1500-byte burst is:

Step 2: Clock Domain Mismatch Handling

The write clock (10 MHz) and read clock (100 MHz) introduce a rate mismatch. To ensure the FIFO does not overflow or underflow:

Write Rate: 1 word is written every .

Read Rate: 1 word is read every .

For a 1500-byte burst (375 words):

Time to Write the Burst:

Words Read in the Same Time:

Since the read clock is faster, the FIFO wonâ€™t overflow during this burst.

Step 3: FIFO Depth Recommendation

Minimum FIFO Depth: To hold the burst, you need at least 375 words
