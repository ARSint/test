This Verilog module implements an APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) Finite State Machine (FSM) for an Ethernet subsystem interface. It manages read and write transactions between the APB master and a controller. Below is an overview of its functionality and key features:

Functionality:
State Machine:

Operates in three states:
IDLE: The default state where no operations occur.
SETUP: Prepares for a transaction when the APB device is selected (PSEL is high).
ENABLE: Executes read or write operations based on PWRITE.
Read/Write Transactions:

In the ENABLE state:
Write Transaction: Transfers data (PWDATA) and write strobes (PSTRB) to the controller when the FIFO is not full.
Read Transaction: Provides data (PRDATA) from the controller to the APB bus when the FIFO is not empty.
Error Handling:

Signals errors using PSLVERR for invalid addresses or controller-reported errors.
Integrates FIFO backpressure handling with signals fifo_full and fifo_empty to ensure safe data flow.
Reset Logic:

All outputs and internal registers are reset to their default states on an active-low reset (i_reset_n).
Controller Interface:

Outputs signals (CTRL_WDATA, CTRL_ADDR, CTRL_WR_EN, CTRL_RD_EN) to interact with the Ethernet subsystem controller.
Accepts read data (CTRL_RDATA) and status signals from the controller.
APB Compliance:

Implements APB-specific handshaking signals (PREADY, PWRITE, PENABLE) and uses address and data buses (PADDR, PWDATA).
Key Features:
Parameterization: Configurable address (ADDR_WIDTH) and data widths (DATA_WIDTH) to suit various APB implementations.
FIFO Support: Handles backpressure with FIFO status signals to avoid overflow or underflow.
Error Detection: Supports error signaling for invalid addresses and other controller-detected failures.
Low-Power Operation: Returns to the IDLE state when not actively processing transactions.
This module is designed for use in systems requiring efficient APB interfacing with an Ethernet subsystem controller, ensuring proper protocol adherence and robust error handling.


Core Functionality
AXI Transaction Management:

Generates AXI master control signals for read (o_axi_mread) and write (o_axi_mwrite) operations.
Handles AXI responses (i_axi_sresp and i_axi_svalid) and raises error flags for slave or decode errors.
FIFO Interface Integration:

Supports seamless data flow using dedicated signals for read and write FIFOs.
Implements backpressure management using FIFO status signals (write_fifo_empty and read_fifo_full).
FSM Workflow:

IDLE: Prepares for a new transaction. Resets counters and address registers.
AXI_REQ: Initiates an AXI read or write operation based on the mode (i_rw).
AXI_RES: Processes the response from the AXI slave and updates FIFOs or raises error flags accordingly.
Address and Byte Counter Management:

Automatically increments addresses and counters during a transaction to support multi-byte transfers.
Tracks progress using the counter register and byte-length input (byte_length).
Error Handling:

Detects and processes AXI slave errors (SLVERR) and decode errors.
Provides clear status flags (o_axi_slverr, o_axi_decoderr) for error reporting.
Mode Selection:

Operates in AXI mode when i_fuse_enable is low (logic 0).
