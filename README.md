This Verilog module implements an APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) Finite State Machine (FSM) for an Ethernet subsystem interface. It manages read and write transactions between the APB master and a controller. Below is an overview of its functionality and key features:

Functionality:
State Machine:

Operates in three states:
IDLE: The default state where no operations occur.
SETUP: Prepares for a transaction when the APB device is selected (PSEL is high).
ENABLE: Executes read or write operations based on PWRITE.
Read/Write Transactions:

In the ENABLE state:
Write Transaction: Transfers data (PWDATA) and write strobes (PSTRB) to the controller when the FIFO is not full.
Read Transaction: Provides data (PRDATA) from the controller to the APB bus when the FIFO is not empty.
Error Handling:

Signals errors using PSLVERR for invalid addresses or controller-reported errors.
Integrates FIFO backpressure handling with signals fifo_full and fifo_empty to ensure safe data flow.
Reset Logic:

All outputs and internal registers are reset to their default states on an active-low reset (i_reset_n).
Controller Interface:

Outputs signals (CTRL_WDATA, CTRL_ADDR, CTRL_WR_EN, CTRL_RD_EN) to interact with the Ethernet subsystem controller.
Accepts read data (CTRL_RDATA) and status signals from the controller.
APB Compliance:

Implements APB-specific handshaking signals (PREADY, PWRITE, PENABLE) and uses address and data buses (PADDR, PWDATA).
Key Features:
Parameterization: Configurable address (ADDR_WIDTH) and data widths (DATA_WIDTH) to suit various APB implementations.
FIFO Support: Handles backpressure with FIFO status signals to avoid overflow or underflow.
Error Detection: Supports error signaling for invalid addresses and other controller-detected failures.
Low-Power Operation: Returns to the IDLE state when not actively processing transactions.
This module is designed for use in systems requiring efficient APB interfacing with an Ethernet subsystem controller, ensuring proper protocol adherence and robust error handling.
